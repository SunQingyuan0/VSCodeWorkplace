/*Every city in Berland is situated on Ox axis. The government of the country decided to build new telecasting station. After many experiments Berland scientists came to a conclusion that in any city citizens displeasure is equal to product of citizens amount in it by distance between city and TV-station. Find such point on Ox axis for station so that sum of displeasures of all cities is minimal.
Input

Input begins from line with integer positive number N (0<N<15000) â€“ amount of cities in Berland. Following N pairs (X, P) describes cities (0<X, P<50000), where X is a coordinate of city and P is an amount of citizens. All numbers separated by whitespace(s).


Output

Write the best position for TV-station with accuracy 10-5.
